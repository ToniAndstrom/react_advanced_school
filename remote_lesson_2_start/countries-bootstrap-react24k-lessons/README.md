## Coutries App

A project we made in class (at Helsinki Business College) using React, that fetches an API of countries that we can filter, add to favourites and remove from favourites. Each Country is displayed in its separate card with its flag and additional information. We used Firebase for the backend. You can also log in and log out after registration.
